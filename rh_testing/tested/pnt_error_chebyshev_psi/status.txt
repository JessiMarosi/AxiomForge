Claim:
RH ⇒ Chebyshev psi error term
ψ(x) = x + O(√x · log^2 x)

Status:
FAILED

Failure Type:
Analytic boundary (not formal / not logical)

Failure Point:
MiniProver.Workbench.Analytic.toNormalForm

Reason:
Reduction RH → ψ(x) error bound verified structurally via Lean obligation skeleton.
Failure occurs at analytic layer: explicit formula bridge, zero-sum bounds under Re(ρ)=1/2,
and remainder control (obligations C3–C5) require analytic normal form machinery
not yet implemented in Axiom Forge.

Notes:
- This is a consequence test only (not an equivalence entry).
- ψ(x) denotes the Chebyshev function ψ(x) = ∑_{n ≤ x} Λ(n).
