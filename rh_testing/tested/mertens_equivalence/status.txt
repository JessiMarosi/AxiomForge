Claim:
RH ⇔ Mertens / Möbius bound
(M(x) = ∑_{n≤x} μ(n) satisfies M(x) = O(x^{1/2+η}) for all η > 0)

Status:
FAILED

Failure Type:
Analytic infrastructure boundary

Failure Point:
MiniProver.Workbench.Analytic.toNormalForm

Reason:
Analytic normal form not implemented (Phase 24 scaffold only).

Date Tested:
2025-12-28

Notes:
- Reduction skeleton encoded in user-mode.
- Obligations surfaced deterministically.
- Dashboard execution reached analytic layer and failed honestly.
- No mathematical contradiction asserted.
