# Axiom Forge Policy (Proof Record + Conduct)

Date: 2025-12-23
Project: Axiom Forge

## 1) Authorship and Responsibility
All mathematical claims, definitions, theorem statements, and proof decisions in this repository are made by the human author(s).
Automated tools (including proof assistants, scripts, and AI drafting assistance) may be used for verification and workflow support only.
The human author(s) take full responsibility for correctness and for any public claims made about results.

## 2) Append-Only Project History
This project’s shared history is append-only:
- Do not rewrite published history (no rebases, squashes, or force-pushes to shared branches).
- Preserve a clear timeline of changes via normal commits.

## 3) Public Claim Discipline
Until a result has stable exposition and has been submitted for community review (e.g., preprint/journal submission):
- Do not publicly claim “final proof” or definitive resolution of the Riemann Hypothesis.
- Use careful language such as “work in progress” or “formal investigation.”

## 4) Recording and Documentation
Recording: Repository state and verification status are recorded via version control and deterministic builds.
Documentation: Short human notes may be added at major decision points to preserve intent; informal notes do not override formal verification.
