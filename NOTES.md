# Axiom Forge — Working Notes

Purpose:
This file records brief human notes at major decision points
to preserve intent and reasoning that are not captured by formal proofs.

Guidelines:
- Write notes only at conceptual forks, reductions, or abandoned paths.
- Keep entries short (2–10 lines).
- Do not attempt to narrate every proof step.
- Informal notes do not override formal verification.

Format (optional):
- Date
- Context (file / section)
- Decision and rationale
