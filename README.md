# Axiom Forge

Version: v0.4.4

## What This Repository Is

This repository contains the **Axiom Forge framework** as a public, reproducible artifact.
It is intended as a **portfolio-quality demonstration** of an audit-grade, deterministic
research governance system built with Lean 4 and mathlib.

It is not a research log and **intentionally excludes exploratory mathematics**.

## RH Testing Framework (Deterministic · Auditable)

Axiom Forge includes a deterministic workflow for testing **published RH-equivalent statements**
by encoding reductions as explicit obligation checklists and capturing verifiable dashboard artifacts.

## About the Riemann Hypothesis

The Riemann Hypothesis appears in this repository **only as a stress test**.

This codebase:
- does **NOT** attempt to prove or disprove the Riemann Hypothesis
- does **NOT** claim progress toward the Clay Millennium Prize
- does **NOT** encode analytic number theory arguments

The RH demo exists solely to demonstrate that published RH-equivalent formulations
can be decomposed into explicit, auditable obligation inventories under strict determinism.

Active RH research, if any, is conducted separately and is **not part of this repository**.

**Demo goal (LOCKED):**  
The purpose of this demo is not to advance analytic number theory, but to demonstrate that
RH-equivalent formulations can be reduced to a finite, auditable set of typed analytic
obligations under strict determinism.
