## RH Testing Framework (Deterministic / Auditable)

Axiom Forge includes a deterministic workflow for testing **published RH-equivalent statements** by encoding reductions as explicit obligation checklists and capturing verifiable dashboard artifacts.

**Demo goal (LOCKED):** The purpose of this demo is not to advance analytic number theory, but to demonstrate that RH-equivalent formulations can be reduced to a finite, auditable set of typed analytic obligations under strict determinism.

See: `docs/rh_testing.md` and `rh_testing/compilation/SUMMARY.md`.
